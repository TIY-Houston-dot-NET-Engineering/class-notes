## Topics to cover (to the end of class)

- Abstractions and structure added to DNCB
- A little bit more on Generics (`where`)
- SQLite -> ADO.NET -> EF -> show SQL from EF -> Npgsql and hosted PostgreSQL on Heroku
- migrations, EF tools in CLI
- Model Validation
- building own services (email? sms? file uploads?)
- Vertical slice architecture
- CQRS
- Domain Driven Design
- Environment vars
- Authentication -> User Model, Password/Email/Hash+Salt -> ASP.NET Identity/Auth -> OAuth (login with X)
- Stuntman
- Reflection - is, as, typeof, X.GetType()
- RegEx

    ```cs
    string zipexp = @"\d{5}((-|\s)?\d{4})?$";
    string addr="W.44th St, New York, NY 10017-0233";
    Match m = Regex.Match(addr,zipexp); // Static method
    Regex zipRegex= new Regex(zipexp);
    m = zipRegex.Match(addr); // Use Regex Object
    Console.WriteLine(m.Value); // 10017-0233
    ```

    Pattern | Description | Example
    :--|:--|:--
    `+` | Match one or more occurrence | ab+c matches abc, abbc
    `*` | Match zero or more occurrences | ab*c matches ac, abbc
    ? | Matches zero or one occurrence | ab?c matches ac, abc
    \d \D | Match decimal digit or non-digit (\D) | \d\d matches 01, 55
    \w \W | Match any word character or non-char | \w equals [a-zA-Z0-9_]
    \s \S | Match whitespace or non-whitespace | \d*\s\d+ matches 246 98
    [ ] | Match any character in set | [aeiou]n matches in, on
    [^ ] | Match any character not in set | [^aeiou] matches r or 2
    `a | b` | Either a or b | `jpg|jpeg|gif` matches .jpg
    \n \r \t | New line, carriage return, tab

- operator overloading
- indexers (`public string this[int index] {get {...}, set {...}}`) (can be overloaded to take `string` and even be multidimensional)
- JavaScript & React

## ASP.NET MVC Controller Review

A route can return a view, or a status message with data

```c#
return View("~/Path/to/view");
return View("~/Path/to/view", new Post); // with a ViewModel
return View(new Post); // just a ViewModel, defaults to Views/ControllerName/ActionName.cshtml
return Ok("ok."); // 200 OK - JSON response
return Ok(new { some="data", can="be sent here" }); // 200 OK - JSON response
```

A route can take arguments and save to the db (via repository)

```c#
[HttpPost("{id?}")]
[HttpPut("/update/{id}")]
public IActionResult Create([FromBody] Post p, [FromForm] Post other, int id){
    postRepo.Create(p); // a Repo<T> should be responsible for saving to the DB
    return Ok(p);
}

/**
    Other attributes for Model Binding
    [BindRequired]: This attribute adds a model state error if binding cannot occur.
    [BindNever]: Tells the model binder to never bind to this parameter.
    [FromHeader], [FromQuery], [FromRoute], [FromForm]: Use these to specify the exact binding source you want to apply.
    [FromServices]: This attribute uses dependency injection to bind parameters from services.
    [FromBody]: Use the configured formatters to bind data from the request body. The formatter is selected based on content type of the request.
    [ModelBinder]: Used to override the default model binder, binding source and name.
**/
```

Each Route will respond to all HTTP Verbs unless you explicitly use a particular attribute for the verb you want:

```c#
[HttpPost] / [HttpPost("sub/route/{id}")]
[HttpGet] / [HttpGet("sub/route/{id}")]
[HttpPut] / [HttpPut("sub/route/other/route")]
[HttpDelete] / etc
```

A Controller can define a root route, too! Then your route methods can define the subroute:

```c#
[Route("/mycontroller")]
class MyController : Controller {
    [HttpGet("{id?}")]
    public IActionResult Get(int? id){
        // ...
    }
}
```

Each Route that handles Post/Put data may also need some extra security measures:

```c#
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
```

Route methods can be async:

```c#
public async Task<IActionResult> GetPosts(...){
    var posts = await GetPostsFromDB();
}
```

Views have a few instance properties inherited from the ASP.NET MVC Controller class:

```c#
public IActionResult Index(){
    ViewData                // Dictionary<string, string> that is accessible inside View()s
    ModelState              // contains the model instance being passed into the route (auto-parsed by MVC), has properties like ModelState.IsValid
    RedirectToLocal(url)    // redirect a client to a different url on the server
    AddErrors(...)          // build up errors to send
}
```

## SQL

- For managing local SQLite: http://sqlitebrowser.org/
- For managing local PostgreSQL: http://dbglass.web-pal.com/

Common SQL Commands

- CREATE <DATABASE | TABLE>
- INSERT - inserts new data into a database
- SELECT - extracts data from a database
- UPDATE - updates data in a database
- DELETE - deletes data from a database
- ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
- ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
- CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
- DROP TABLE - deletes a table
- DROP INDEX - deletes an index

Let's create a DB with Products

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Mattazon

CREATE TABLE Products
    (ProductID int Primary key not null,
     ProductName varchar(25) not null,
     Price money null,
     ProductDescription text null)

# A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table. PK's are required.

INSERT Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, ProductDescription)
    VALUES (1, 'Clamp', 12.48, 'Workbench clamp')

# Changing the order is ok as long as the Column Name and Value align (1st item is ID, 2nd is Name, ...)

INSERT Products (ProductName, ProductID, Price, ProductDescription)
VALUES ('Screwdriver', 50, 3.17, 'Flat head')

# Not having the Column Names is okay as long as you have a value for each one

INSERT Products
VALUES (75, 'Tire Bar', NULL, 'Tool for changing tires.')

# View the data in the table

SELECT * FROM Products

# Change the data already in the table

UPDATE Products
SET ProductName = 'Flat Head Screwdriver'
WHERE ProductID = 50

# Select specific columns

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Price, ProductDescription
FROM Products

# Returns only two of the columns from the table

SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products

# Filter for items that match a predicate

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Price, ProductDescription
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID < 60

# You can do stuff to the values and return them as a new temp colum

# Returns ProductName and the Price including a 7% tax
# Provides the name CustomerPays for the calculated column
SELECT ProductName, Price * 1.07 AS CustomerPays
FROM Products

# Deleting data

DELETE FROM Products WHERE ProductID = 50 # one row
DELETE FROM Products # all rows

# "Migrations" - Altering a table

ALTER TABLE Products ADD Manufacturer text

ALTER Database Mattazon MODIFY Name = Mattbay

DROP Table Products

USE Master DROP Database Mattazon

# Aggregates

# MIN # returns the smallest value in a given column
SELECT MIN(Price) FROM Products

# MAX # returns the largest value in a given column
SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Products

# SUM # returns the sum of the numeric values in a given column
SELECT SUM(Price) FROM Products

# AVG # returns the average value of a given column
SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products

# COUNT # returns the total number of values in a given column (doesnâ€™t count NULLs)
SELECT COUNT(Price) FROM Products
COUNT(*) # returns the number of rows in a table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Products
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Products WHERE Price < 100

# GROUP BY
SELECT Price FROM Products GROUP BY Price
SELECT ProductName, MAX(Price) FROM Products GROUP BY ProductName
SELECT ProductName, MAX(Price) FROM Products GROUP BY ProductName having MAX(Price) > 20

# ORDER BY
SELECT ProductName, Price FROM Products ORDER BY Price
SELECT * FROM Products ORDER BY Price ASC
SELECT * FROM Products ORDER BY Price DESC

# Combining conditions and BOOLEAN
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price > 20 AND Price < 200
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price > 20 AND ProductDescription IS NOT NULL

# IN
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName IN ('Prod1', 'Prod4');

# BETWEEN
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 12 AND 200

# Math
# +   addition
# -   subtraction
# *   multiplication
# /   division
# %   modulo

ABS(x) # returns the absolute value of x
SIGN(x) # returns the sign of input x as -1, 0, or 1 (negative, zero, or positive respectively)
MOD(x,y) # modulo - returns the integer remainder of x divided by y (same as x%y)
FLOOR(x) # returns the largest integer value that is less than or equal to x
CEILING(x) or CEIL(x) # returns the smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to x
POWER(x,y) # returns the value of x raised to the power of y
ROUND(x) # returns the value of x rounded to the nearest whole integer
ROUND(x,d) # returns the value of x rounded to the number of decimal places specified by the value d
SQRT(x) # returns the square-root value of x

# INNER JOIN (Simple Join): Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables

SELECT * FROM Products, Manufacturers
   WHERE Products.ManufID =
   Manufacturers.ManufID

SELECT * FROM Products
   INNER JOIN Manufacturers ON Products.ManufID =
   Manufacturers.ManufID

SELECT * FROM Products
   JOIN Manufacturers ON Products.ManufID =
   Manufacturers.ManufID

# LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table

SELECT * FROM Products
   LEFT JOIN Manufacturers ON Products.ManufID =
   Manufacturers.ManufID

# RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table

SELECT * FROM Products
   RIGHT JOIN Manufacturers ON Products.ManufID =
   Manufacturers.ManufID

# FULL JOIN/FULL OUTER JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables

SELECT * FROM Products
   FULL JOIN Manufacturers ON Products.ManufID =
   Manufacturers.ManufID

SELECT * FROM Products
   FULL OUTER JOIN Manufacturers ON Products.ManufID =
   Manufacturers.ManufID

# UNION - combines the result of two or more SELECT statements

SELECT City FROM Products
    UNION
    SELECT City FROM Manufacturers

# Nested Queries

SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE Orders.CustomerID =
    (SELECT Customers.CustomerID
    FROM Customers
    WHERE Customers.Phone = '030-0074321')

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Products.CategoryID =
    (SELECT Categories.CategoryID
    FROM Categories
    WHERE Categories.CategoryName = 'Seafood')

SELECT * FROM Orders O
WHERE O.EmployeeID IN
    (SELECT E.EmployeeID
    FROM Employees E
    WHERE O.ShipCity = E.City)

# Foreign Keys
-- The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
-- The FOREIGN KEY constraint also prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the table it points to

# **Relationships**
-- One to One
-- One to Many
-- Many to Many

## Messin with SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products
    (ProductID int Primary key not null,
     ProductName varchar(25) not null,
     Price int null,
     ProductDescription text null)

SELECT * FROM Posts ORDER BY createdAt DESC Limit 5

# Intersection - include only the boards with cardlists, include only the cardlists with boards
SELECT * FROM Boards
    INNER JOIN CardLists ON Board.Id = CardLists.BoardId

# Union left - include all boards, and include any cardlists that belong to a board
SELECT * FROM Boards
    JOIN CardLists ON Board.Id = CardLists.BoardId

# Same thing, more explicit
SELECT * FROM Boards
    LEFT JOIN CardLists ON Board.Id = CardLists.BoardId

# Union right - include all cardlists, include only the boards that a card belongs to
SELECT * FROM Boards
    RIGHT JOIN CardLists ON Board.Id = CardLists.BoardId
```

```c#
// the way it used to be
var string productId = Console.ReadLine(); // 1
SqlConnection.Execute($"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Id = {productId}"); // "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Id = 1"

var string productId = Console.ReadLine(); // "1 \n DROP DATABASE; --"
SqlConnection.Execute($"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Id = {productId}"); // "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Id = 1; \n DROP DATABASE --;"
```

## Inner vs Outer, Left vs. Right vs. Full Join

/*    INNER | OUTER
      -------------
LEFT  | LI  | LO  |
      -------------
RIGHT | RI  | RO  |
      ------------
FULL  | FI  | FO  |
      ------------
*/
